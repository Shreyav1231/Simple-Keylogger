# Simple-Keylogger
This python code logs your keys. Type something anywhere and it knows! <br/>
How to use - <br/>
Clone this repo, run it on your own machine and you're good to go. <br/>

I added ------Backspace------ so that you know how many times the user backspaced, so that you can find the exact word they typed.
